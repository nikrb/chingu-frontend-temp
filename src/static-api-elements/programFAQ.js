    ques: "What exactly is a Voyage?",
    ans: `
      <p>A Voyage is collection of remote developers, designers and data science teams working on projects.</p>
    `
  },
  {
    ques: "How will I be matched with my team?",
    ans: `
      <p>We use a variety of parameters and this is changing constantly as we improve, 
      but it involves timezone, tech-stack familiarity and commitment availability.</p>    
    `

  {
    ques: "What if I have questions along the way?",
    ans: `
      <p>You definitely will have questions and there will be many areas to ask them, 
      including team channels, community chats, a question channel, and by making a ticket.</p>
    `
  },
  {
    ques: "What happens if we don't complete our project in time?",
    ans: `
      <p>In a typical Voyage we may launch 70-110 different teams. 
      These teams will range from people working on landing pages, to data science 
      projects to full stack applications. Projects will have different ambition levels 
      and scope, and some wonâ€™t be able to finish in the time frame. That is completely okay 
      and we always have some teams that transfer into the next Voyage to continue working on it.</p>
