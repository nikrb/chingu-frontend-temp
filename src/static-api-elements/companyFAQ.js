      <p>Our goal is to maintain a learning project focused not only helping our members

    ques: "How can Chingu benefit me? ",
    ans: `
      <p>Becoming a job-ready Web Developer, Data Scientist, or Designer isn’t just about acquiring 
      hard technical skills. It’s also about being able to analyze problems to arrive at the best solution, 
      organizing a project, collaborating in a team, and using Agile methodologies.</p>

      <p>Chingu is a global level-ups community & ecosystem for developers, designers and data scientists. 
      Chingu helps you level-up your skills, meet coder friends, and build projects.</p>

      <p>Here is what we do: put motivated people with similar learning goals together in an environment 
      that gives them the opportunity to level-up in a way they couldn't otherwise. Friendships, level ups 
      and hijinks ensue. The Chingu project aims to create more of a bootcamp style community, but with more 
      flexibility.</p>

    ques: "What are the principles guiding the Chingu organization?",
    ans: `
      <p>The main goal of Chingu is to create an environment that promotes 
      learning and collaborating so members can acquire, expand, and refine “job ready” 
      skills. This is most effective when that environment is a friendly place for open 
      expression of thoughts, ideas, and even mistakes.</p>

      <p>Our open environment is based on the following core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>We are open and tolerant of all cultures and lifestyles. </em></p>

          <p>The only thing we do not tolerate is discourtesy and unprofessional behavior.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><em>We encourage our members to be honest  and supportive. </em></p>

          <p>Members should communicate freely and openly with one another to promote ideas, 
          ask questions, and even share lessons learned from mistakes as long as it is done 
          in a professional manner.</p>
        </li> 

        <li>
          <p><em>Transparency in everything we do.</em></p>

          <p>Maintaining the support and respect of our members requires that we are transparent 
          in the way we manage, operate, and extend the capabilities of the Chingu platform. 
          Chingu was created to help self-directed learners in technology who are our greatest 
          source of ideas.</p>
        </li> 

        <li>
          <p><em>Apply structure only to maximize learning.</em></p>

          <p>We are an Agile organization both in terms of our mindset and the methodologies .
          we utilize. Being Agile requires us to create create structure and bureaucracy only 
          when necessary so we can remain nimble and continuously improve the Chingu project.</p>
        </li>  

        <li>
          <p><em>Work hard, Play hard</em></p>

          <p>Learning is hard work and requires both effort and commitment on the part of our members. 
          Each Chingu is responsible for their own progress. However, this must be balanced with a 
          healthy sense of play. Chingu communities reflect an equal mix of work and play.</p>
        </li>
